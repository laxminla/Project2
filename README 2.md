Project Title: Project 2 - Supply Chain Tracking App


Project Description: Our application will take in product data from producers and store information about the products across multiple databases.



User Story: 
As a Producer: I enter information about goods I have produced into a form, and the information is stored in a productsAvailable database to be queried. 

As a Producer: I can set a price when I enter a good into the application.

As a Producer: When a product is sold I want the productsSold database to be updated. I enter information about goods I have sold in a day/ I want to update.

As a Producer: The application tracks the amount of revenue I generate.

As a Consumer: I can access data about what products are available, by querying our restful API.

As a Consumer: When I choose to purchase a good, the good is deleted from the productsAvailable database, and added to the productsSold database.

As a Consumer: I can log in, and once I’ve purchased an item it is stored in a ownedByConsumer database.

As a Consumer: The application tracks the amount of money I have left, and doesn’t let me purchase items I cannot afford.
